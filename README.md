### Flower Wordle
This is a simple Wordle recreation using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

It has a limited dictionary of flower names and it's meant to be run client-side.
Just download or clone this repository and open the index.html file in your browser.

I worked on this as a refresher for JS and CSS.
